### Does UdonSharp support X feature?
If Udon supports it, then so does UdonSharp.

_Check [Class exposure tree](https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp/wiki/class-exposure-tree)_

### Are prefabs supported fully?
You can use prefabs with Udon and U#, but changes to serialized fields on those prefabs will not propagate to instances of the prefab correctly due to limitations in Unity.

### Can I access the player camera?
No, you can not access the player's camera. You can, however, get the head position and rotation.

See [VRCPlayerApi.GetTrackingData](https://creators.vrchat.com/worlds/udon/players/player-positions/#gettrackingdata)
 
`Vector3 headPos = localPlayer.GetTrackingData(TrackingDataType.Head).position;`

### Can I have more than one UdonSharp Udon Behavior on a GameObject?
Yes.

### I'm starting from scratch and need to use C# tutorials. What common aspects of C# don't work in UdonSharp?
If you are learning UdonSharp and not familiar with C# already, you may run across some commonly used techniques that don't work in Udon and UdonSharp yet. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Enums not already defined by Unity
- Generic classes (`Class<T>`) and methods
- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- Method overloads
- Properties

The [main UdonSharp page](https://udonsharp.docs.vrchat.com/#differences-from-regular-unity-c-to-note) lists additional differences between UdonSharp and C#.
