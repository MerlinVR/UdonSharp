# Exporting to Assembly Files
This will explain how to export your U# program source assets to assembly assets for sharing without sharing the actual U# scripts

---

### Before exporting
Make sure you uncheck `Inline Code` in `Edit > Project Settings > Udon Sharp` so it doesn't include any script code in the exported file

---

### Exporting the assembly file
To export a assembly file from your U# program source asset, locate the asset you want to export.

With it selected, in the inspector you will see a button `Export to Assembly Asset`

Click it and save the file somewhere, and that's it.

You can now share this with people without giving away the C# code.
